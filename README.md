# Time-series-forecasting-for-electricity-usage
Given the rise of smart electricity meters and the wide adoption of electricity generation technology like solar panels, there is a wealth of electricity usage data available. This data represents a multivariate time series of power-related variables that in turn could be used to model and even forecast future electricity consumption.

The ‘Household Power Consumption‘ dataset is a multivariate time series dataset that describes the electricity consumption for a single household over four years. The data was collected between December 2006 and November 2010 and observations of power consumption within the household were collected every minute.
